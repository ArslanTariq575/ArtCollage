# ArtCollage
This Java program is designed to take any size jpeg picture and convert it into a collage based on user input for the number of rows and columns. The program allows the user to specify the dimensions of the final collage by inputting the number of rows and columns desired.

Once the user has inputted the dimensions, the program creates a new collage image with the specified number of rows and columns. The original picture is
then resized to fit within the dimensions of the collage, and each section of the picture is cropped and inserted into the corresponding position in the 
collage.

In addition to creating the collage, the program also allows the user to replace a picture in a certain row and column of the collage. The user simply 
needs to input the row and column number of the picture they want to replace and then select a new picture to insert into that position.

Furthermore, the program also allows users to change the colors of the picture within the collage. The user can select the color they want to change and 
then specify the new color they want to replace it with.

Overall, this Java program is a useful tool for creating collages from pictures and offers the ability to replace pictures and change colors within the 
collage. It demonstrates the effective use of Java programming techniques such as image processing and user input handling to achieve this goal.
